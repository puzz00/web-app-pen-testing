gathering information is the first step in hacking web applications - we want to gather as much information as this will make it easier to find ways to hack it

a good way to picture this is by thinking about the attack surface - if we gather lots of information the attack surface increases - is it better to shoot lots of bullets at a small target or just one at a large target ğŸ¤”

in this stage there is no such thing as irrelevant data - we need to record everything that we find
